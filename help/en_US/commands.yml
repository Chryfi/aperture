                {r}{o}Aperture server command{r}. This command can be used to make given player (by an entity selector) start playing camera profile.
                
                {l}{6}/{r}aperture {8}play{r} {7}<camera_profile> [target]{r}
                
                {r}If you pass only {7}<camera_profile>{r}, then the given camera profile will be played using current player. If you pass two arguments after {8}play{r}, then you would be able to specify a {7}<camera_profile>{r} to be played on given player(s) using entity {7}[target]{r} selector.

        start: "{r}Starts a camera profile. Optionally starting from given {7}[tick]{r}."
        stop: "{r}Stops currently running camera profile."
        default: "{r}Resets camera's {7}Field-Of-View{r} and {7}roll{r} to default values ({7}70.0{r} and {7}0.0{r} degrees)."

        roll: "{r}Set or get client's camera {7}[roll]{r} (rotation across {7}Z-axis{r})."
        rotate: "{r}Set camera's angle based on absolute or relative values. You can set absolute angle of the camera by specifying plain floating point numbers {6}/camera {8}rotate {7}90 90{r}. Or you can provide a relative value by using {7}~+{r} or {7}~-{r} signs {6}/camera {8}rotate {7}~0.5 ~-0.5{r}."
        step: "{r}Set camera's position based on absolute or relative values. You can set absolute position of the camera by specifying plain floating point numbers {6}/camera {8}step {7}0 4 0{r}. Or you can provide a relative value by using {7}~+{r} or {7}~-{r} signs {6}/camera {8}step {7}~0 ~0.1 ~0{r}. It works similar to {6}/tp{r} command."
