**Disclaimer**: this mod has nothing to do with Aperture Science from Portal games. See the article on what is [Aperture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture) actually is.

**Aperture** is a Minecraft mod which allows you to create advanced camera movement (for cinematics or machinimas) using camera editor GUI. It works with Forge for Minecraft 1.12.2 (past versions are available for 1.10.2 and 1.11.2).

Aperture is also available in Chinese language thanks to [ycwei982](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfUDMSGlXUblXimkvNl_7Ww), Chunk7, H2SO4GepaoAX and KuenYo, and Russian language thanks to [Andruxioid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnHOceBjwMyqCR5oYOoNqhQ)!

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available Minecraft version. Also install following mods: [McLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib). Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Aperture mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Aperture didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong. 

## For whom is this mod for?

If you want to setup cameras for a Minecraft machinima/roleplay, and you already use [Blockbuster mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blockbuster) in **singleplayer**, then this is a mod for you!

Aperture mod provides a ton of features to improve your camera (in comparison to other camera): 

* Camera profiles that lets you load and save camera work.
* Camera fixtures are building blocks within camera profile which lets you flexibly setup different camera movement depending on the type of fixture it is.
* Camera modifiers allow to post process movement to apply certain effects on top of camera fixtures.
* Works with [Minema](https://github.com/daipenger/minema/releases).
* And so much more...

Although Aperture has partial support to work on servers, it's not recommended to use on the servers **as these mechanisms are poorly designed**!

## Bug reports

If you found a bug, or this mod crashed your game, make sure to check this [compatibility table and incompatible mod list](https://github.com/mchorse/mclib/wiki/Compatibility-table-of-McHorse%27s-mods) page. The most frequent issue people encounter is that they didn't install the compatible versions of my mods. Or updated only one mod while using older version of my other mods.
